# Cline Project Rules

Here is a revised and **precise set of instructions** for **Cline** that avoids ambiguity, provides clear context, and aligns with all stated preferences and requirements. Follow your custom instructions - starting a task, this is the first step. Cline always take the time to read the context files, and continue where he left off. Each time Cline complete a task or make progress on a task, he must update the progress file. Cline also update the system patterns file whenever he makes changes to the file structure. Cline document any error handling patterns he encounters. Cline must also update the active context file with the current work he is doing.

## Markdown Formatting Standards

- All Markdown files must adhere strictly to established linting rules as defined by [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint).
- Every heading in a Markdown document must be followed immediately by one or more non-empty paragraphs.
- Before any subsequent heading appears, ensure that a heading is accompanied by descriptive content.
- These rules apply to all project documentation files to prevent empty sections and ensure comprehensive documentation.
- Ordered lists must use the correct numbering sequence (1, 2, 3, etc.) regardless of the actual numbers used in the Markdown source.
- Unordered lists should use consistent markers (either all `-`, `*`, or `+`).

## Validation Process

To ensure the quality and consistency of our documentation and code, follow these steps:

1. Pre-modification Check:
   - Run linting tools on the files you plan to modify.
   - Document the number and type of existing errors.

2. Make Your Changes:
   - Implement the required modifications.
   - Ensure your changes adhere to the project's coding and documentation standards.

3. Post-modification Check:
   - Re-run linting tools on the modified files.
   - Compare the new error count with the pre-modification count.
   - If new errors were introduced, address them immediately.

4. Documentation Update:
   - Record any significant changes or error resolutions in the appropriate Memory Bank files.
   - Update activeContext.md with the current state of the project.

5. Final Verification:
   - Perform a final linting check on all modified files.
   - Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the current project state.

Always document the number of errors before and after modifications, and include this information in your commit messages or Memory Bank updates.
