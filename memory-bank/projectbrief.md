# Project Brief

This project implements a comprehensive Next.js development environment, featuring reactive development practices and robust error handling capabilities. The environment emphasizes:

- Systematic Next.js development approach
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- VSCode and GitHub Copilot integration
- Clear development and documentation workflows

The project utilizes a dual-mode development system that combines Next.js best practices with reactive error handling, ensuring consistent and effective development across all aspects of the application.

## Development Approach

The project operates through incremental development sessions, each building upon previous work:

1. **Session-Based Development**
   - Focused development periods
   - Clear session boundaries
   - Memory Bank updates between sessions
   - Knowledge preservation across sessions
   - Continuous documentation

2. **Template Foundation**
   - Next.js template initialized
   - Base structure established
   - Ready for incremental improvements
   - Foundation for session work
