# Project Brief

The project implements a systematic approach to software development, featuring an enhanced decision-making and collaboration model that ensures structured, efficient workflows while maintaining an optimal balance between autonomy and user control. This refined model emphasizes:

- Structured, strategic collaboration with iterative progress
- Small, focused responses over overwhelming text blocks
- Proactive, autonomous guidance while preserving user authority
- Clear decision-making processes and collaboration frameworks

The project utilizes a dual-mode problem-solving system that combines collaboration principles with a robust problem-solving framework, ensuring consistent and effective decision-making across all aspects of development.

## Overview

The project emphasizes a refined decision-making structure that incorporates:

1. **Tiered Decision Model**
   - Simple decisions (self-resolvable with user confirmation)
   - Complex decisions (requiring alternative evaluation)
   - Clear actionability in problem-solving
   - Efficient decision-making loops

2. **Collaboration Framework**
   - Spot → Get → Think → Weigh → Pick → Make → Check workflow
   - Problem recognition and opportunity identification
   - Systematic information gathering
   - Thorough alternatives evaluation
   - Clear decision execution paths
   - Robust monitoring and feedback

3. **Enhanced Autonomy**
   - Self-resolution of trivial decisions
   - Action suggestions over open questions
   - Cost/benefit analysis for alternatives
   - Context memory utilization

Project maintains flexibility for future expansion while ensuring all decisions follow the established framework.
