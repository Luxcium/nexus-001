## Session-Based Development

The project follows an incremental, session-based development approach with strict documentation protocols:

1. **Session Management and Documentation Protocol**

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
      A[Session Start] --> B[Context Load]
      B --> C[Development Work]
      C --> D[Pre-Close Validation]
      D --> E[Memory Bank Update]
      E --> F[Pattern Learning]
      F --> G[Context Preservation]
      G --> H[Session Close]
   ```

   - Pre-session context loading and validation
   - Continuous work documentation during session
   - Knowledge preservation before session close
   - Memory Bank synchronization checkpoint
   - Pattern learning from session activities
   - AI-assisted context validation

2. **Documentation Lifecycle Tracking**
   - Mandatory Memory Bank updates with verification
   - Session boundary documentation with timestamps
   - Continuous progress tracking with AI validation
   - Knowledge transfer protocols and verification
   - Pattern detection and learning
   - Cross-session context preservation
   - AI-assisted documentation automation

3. **Session-Based Quality Assurance**
   - Pre-session validation checklist:
     - Memory Bank state verification
     - Context continuity check
     - Previous session resolution validation
     - Pattern consistency verification
   - Post-session completion requirements:
