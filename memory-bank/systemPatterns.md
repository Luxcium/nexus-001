# System Patterns

This document outlines the core architectural patterns and system design principles that support our enhanced decision-making and collaboration model. The patterns ensure systematic, efficient, and maintainable development processes while facilitating clear communication and effective progress tracking.

Key aspects include:

- Decision-making framework integration
- Collaboration workflow patterns
- System architecture patterns
- Quality assurance mechanisms

## Architecture Overview

The system architecture is designed to support efficient decision-making and collaboration through:

1. **Decision Support Layer**
   - Tiered decision processing
   - Evaluation frameworks
   - Documentation systems
   - Validation mechanisms

2. **Collaboration Infrastructure**
   - Communication channels
   - Progress tracking
   - Knowledge sharing
   - Feedback systems

3. **Core Architecture Principles**
   - Modularity and clear boundaries
   - Independent component evolution
   - System coherence maintenance
   - Scalable design patterns

## Design Patterns

The system implements patterns that support effective decision-making and collaboration:

1. **Decision-Making Patterns**
   - Strategy Pattern for decision processes
   - Observer Pattern for progress tracking
   - Chain of Responsibility for approvals
   - Command Pattern for action execution

2. **Collaboration Patterns**
   - Mediator Pattern for communication
   - Publisher-Subscriber for updates
   - Factory Pattern for workflow creation
   - Template Pattern for processes

3. **System Patterns**
   - Repository Pattern for data access
   - Adapter Pattern for integrations
   - Facade Pattern for subsystems
   - Singleton for shared resources

## Component Structure

The system implements a structured component hierarchy:

1. **Decision Support Components**
   - Decision Processors
   - Evaluation Engines
   - Validation Systems
   - Documentation Managers

2. **Collaboration Components**
   - Workflow Managers
   - Progress Trackers
   - Communication Handlers
   - Feedback Systems

3. **Core System Structure**
   - **memory-bank/**: Documentation and context
   - **src/**: Primary source code
   - **tests/**: Comprehensive testing
   - **workflows/**: Process definitions

The structure maintains modularity without enforcing specific monorepo constraints, enabling flexibility and scalability.

## Code Conventions

Conventions supporting decision-making and collaboration:

1. **Decision-Making Code Standards**
   - Clear function purposes
   - Documented decision points
   - Explicit validation steps
   - Error handling patterns

2. **Collaboration Code Practices**
   - Interface consistency
   - Progress tracking hooks
   - Documentation requirements
   - Communication patterns

3. **Language-Specific Standards**
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
     - Strict TypeScript configuration
     - Clear naming conventions
       - PascalCase for classes/types
       - camelCase for functions/variables
     - Named exports preferred

   - **Python:**
     - PEP 8 compliance
     - Explicit naming
     - Absolute imports

   - **Shell Scripts:**
     - POSIX compliance
